# 📊 Probability Distributions Visualized in Python

An educational project demonstrating various probability distributions using Python.  
Each distribution is explored through both its **theoretical formula** (via SciPy) and **practical sampling** (via NumPy), and is visualized using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

The notebook or script covers:

- 📈 **Normal (Gaussian) Distribution**
- 🎲 **Uniform (Discrete & Continuous)**
- 🎯 **Binomial Distribution**
- ⚪ **Bernoulli Distribution**
- 🔔 **Poisson Distribution**
- ⏳ **Exponential Distribution**
- 📐 **Log-Normal Distribution**
- 📘 **t-Distribution**
- 📊 **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- `Python 3.9+`
- `NumPy`
- `SciPy`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`

---

## 📌 Visualizations

Each distribution includes:
- PDF/PMF (Probability functions)
- CDF (Cumulative distribution)
- Histograms (sampled data)
- Side-by-side comparison: **Theoretical vs Practical**
